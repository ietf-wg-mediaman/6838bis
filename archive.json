That specific part of RFC 2026 suggest the appeal process being established appears to me to boil down to:\r\n\r\n* the appeal goes to the IESG, and there's no escalation available past that\r\n* the appeal must provide adequate detail\r\n* the appeal must be filed within two months of the DE's decision\r\n* the IESG has discretion to process the appeal however it wants\r\n* the IESG has to complete its review and deliver its decision in a reasonable amount of time\r\n\r\n...or at least that's how I read it.  Maybe I'm being too pedantic but I also note that RFC 2026 Section 6.5.4 is subordinate to Section 6.5, which says that it (and its subsections) apply to decisions that are made as part of the standards process using consensus development, and decisions of a DE do not meet that definition.  It doesn't look to me like 6.5.4 was meant to be referenced or incorporated in this way.\r\n\r\nI suggest this is something the WG should review and decide whether it wants to keep this as-is or perhaps say something more explicit and crisp.\r\n\r\n",

Thus, I would request that when updating the media type procedures and registry one should consider some clarifications to help identify media types that have RTP payload formats.\n\n1. I would suggest that one add a column in the media types registry for each entry to indicate those that have RTP payload formats. \n2. Secondly there is the question if one like to convert the implicit indicator in the encoding information, that some but not all framed encodings are RTP, and rather have an explicit field in the registration template to say: Media Type has an RTP payload format.

The issue is that the Media Types registry contains more than a hundred media types that are RTP payload formats and this is about handling an existing legacy in an efficient way. \n\nRegarding 2) that have been tried and it fails for the reason that the media types registry is the name space. The seperate registry was never the key one and it was repetealy missed to add the name into this secondary registry. Thus, having a separate registry was tried for a long time and it failed. This is not the first time I wished that the community had come to the conclusion more than 20 years ago that RTP payload types should have its own registry and name space for identifying them, rather than using the media types registry. \n\nRegarding 1) we it would be good to have something that is actually very explicitly, and possible to select on when extracting entries form the registry. Because we have seen IETF external bodies attempting to reference a table of RTP payload formats. And as I noted above this is a significant amount of the registry entries. ",

I think a lot depends on what perspective one has when one comes to the registry itself. Application media type has a lot of file format, the RTP payload formats are few in that category, but if you look at video the majority of standards tree types are RTP payload formats, there are a couple of media bucket file formats. So if one go there and look for what is available to store video one would have to sift through to find the relevant. But, if one assume that one primarily goes to the registry to look up the reference for a seen media type then what is in the registry is all that is needed.\n\n@alvestrand what do you say as you where closer to the usages that wanted to know what RTP Payload formats that exists?\n\n",

For example, the +jwt suffix is used 17 times, and the +json suffix is used over 150 times.

Example: a top-level type of 'oid', leading to types of the form oid/nnnnn, where nnn is an OID (Object Identifier) designating a specific media format,\n\n* A top-level type MUST NOT be defined for the mapping of other protocol elements to media types. For example, while there may be some merit to a mapping from media types to URIs, e.g. in the context of RDF (Resource Description Framework), there is very limited merit in a reverse mapping, and even less merit in creating a top-level type for such a mapping. The same applies to other protocol elements such as file extensions or URI schemes. The recommended solution in case a mapping is needed is to choose a single type/subtype and put the additional information in an appropriately named parameter. As an example, information on a file extension '.dcat' can be encoded as 'application/octet-string; filename=foo.dcat'.\n\n* Media types are not a general type system. A top-level type MUST NOT be defined if its main or only purpose is to map other type systems, e.g. in programming languages or ontologies.\n\n* A new top-level type SHOULD NOT generate aliases for existing widely used types or subtypes.\n\nThere has to be a more efficient and friendly way to convey this; using bullet points implies that they're four different things, and they're not.",

The other parties (reviewer, IANA, IESG) are governed by other types of agreements, and don't need to have their responsibilities codified using 2119 language.\n\nIn particular, notes from PR 34:\n\n2.1.2 - \"Copyright on the registration template MUST allow the IANA to copy it\". While the whole paragraph seems a bit silly to me, this is a hard requirement on the registrant, and MUST is appropriate.\n\n2.4 - \"Media types can be defined to allow...\" - suggest MAY is appropriate here.\n\"the names, values and meanings of any parameters are required to be fully specified....\" - MUST is appropriate here,\nlowercase \"are required\" is not clear enough.\n\n4.1.2 - \"when a third party register a type on behalf of someone else, both entities SHOULD be noted...\" - this is a requirement on the registrant, where 2119 is appropriate.\n\n5.1 - \"Notice of a potential media type registration in the standards tree should be sent...\" this is unclear about who is required to do the sending, I think the registrant is the right entity to send it, and it should be a MUST (was a SHOULD).\n\n5.2.1 - \"provisional registration ... can be submitted to IANA\". Here, I think MUST is appropriate - because you get a registration if you submit this to IANA, you don't get a registration otherwise (for instance by posting on media-types) - and the requirement is on the registrant.\n\nWhen reviewing for this language, I found a few places where it was unclear who does an action (too much passive voice). I'll raise a separate issue on that.\n\n",

For example, while there may be some merit to a mapping from media types to URIs, e.g. in the context of RDF (Resource Description Framework), there is very limited merit in a reverse mapping, and even less merit in creating a top-level type for such a mapping. The same applies to other protocol elements such as file extensions or URI schemes. The recommended solution in case a mapping is needed is to choose a single type/subtype and put the additional information in an appropriately named parameter. As an example, information on a file extension '.dcat' can be encoded as 'application/octet-string; filename=foo.dcat'.\r\n```",
